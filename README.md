# Overview of Audit Election
The purpose of this election audit analysis is to assist Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee with presenting the election results for a United States(US) congressional precinct in Colorado. I am tasked with helping Tom report the total number of votes cast,the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.  Toms manager wanted to know if there was a way to automate the process in Python, so that's why he contacted me; the Python expert.  If this code that Tom and I write is successful, then it could be used in other congressional, senatorial and local precincts throughout the US.  There are three different voting methods to be considered for this data set:  hand-counted, machine counted and computer counted.  My job is to generate a vote count report to certify the election results.
